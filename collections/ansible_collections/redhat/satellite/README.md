# Red Hat Satellite Ansible Collection

## Description

Ansible modules for interacting with the Satellite API.

## Requirements

* [`PyYAML`](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
* [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
* The Python `rpm` bindings for the RPM support in the `content_upload` module

## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it, either directly from Automation Hub or via RPMs provided by Red Hat.

The GitHub repository serves as the source for the release and should not be used for direct installation and consumption of the collection.

### Installation from Automation Hub

To install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.satellite
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:


```yaml
collections:
  - name: redhat.satellite
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.satellite --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.satellite:==1.0.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Installation via RPM

The collection is also available as `ansible-collection-redhat-satellite` in the Satellite repository.


## Testing

This collection is tested against all currently maintained Ansible versions and with all currently supported (by Ansible on the target node) Python versions.
You can find the list of maintained Ansible versions and their respective Python versions on [docs.ansible.com](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html).

## Contributing

This collection is based on the [`theforeman.foreman`](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules) community collection for Foreman and Katello.
If possible, any contributions should go directly to `theforeman.foreman` from where they will flow back into this collection.
